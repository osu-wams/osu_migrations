# OSU Migrations

Contains submodules for D7 to D9 migrations

## OSU Migrations Files
To properly migrate files open up the upgrade_d7_files.yml and set the source_base_path to either the public url of the drupal or set the file path to the root of the distro.

Currently, it is set to the base of this installation so one could copy the files into the container and run the migration.
